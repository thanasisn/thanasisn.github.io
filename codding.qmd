I do data processing mainly with [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

I use [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) more than I should, to glue everything together.

Occasionally will use [python]().

I have used [julia](), [c++](), [octave](), [idl](), [fortran]().

My main environment is [Debian]() and I may migrate to [nixOS]() someday.
